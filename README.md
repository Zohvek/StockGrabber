A simple stock quote fetching WPF application. Writing to learn WPF, comparisson to winforms which I have experience with etc. 

Currently hard-coded to fetch the price of Microsoft's stock from Alpha Vantage's free Stock price API. Displays Max/Min in a textbox.

Don't really have a plan with this one. Just adding features all willy-nilly. 

#todo: dynamically search for stock prices - modify search params to allow custom searches.
#todo: show more info from xml API response - graphs??
